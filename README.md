Bouncer SMS Filter
=====================

This is a simple SMS filtering app for iOS that uses the ILMessageFilterExtension to move unwanted messages to the "Junk" Section.

Different to other apps, Bouncer does not share, upload or send any of your personal information or SMS messages to a remote server.   All the filtering happens locally on your phone.

Messages text is checked against a simple user defined blacklist.

Features
----------------------
* Filter SMS messages using a simple list of words
* Catalog filtered messages in iOS 14+ categories (Junk, Transaction, Promotion)
* Unlimmited number of filter rules
* Automatic migration of filters from Version 1.x
* Localized in English and Spanish


Tech Stack/Specs
----------------------

Bouncer is written 100% in Swift, for iOS 14 and features things like:

* All new SwiftUI lifecycle (No storyboards or Appdelegate)
* Redux-like architecture
* Combine
* SwiftUI 2.x features and improvements
* Zero UIKit
* No 3rd party dependencies ðŸ’ª
