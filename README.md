Bouncer SMS Filter
=====================

This is a simple SMS filtering app for iOS that uses the ILMessageFilterExtension to move unwanted messages to the "Junk" Section.

Different to other apps, Bouncer does not share, upload or send any of your personal information or SMS messages to a remote server.   All the filtering happens locally on your phone.

Messages text is checked against a simple user defined blacklist.

Building
----------------------

Fire up XCode 12 (Currently beta), open Bouncer.xcodeproj and hit Build.  There are no dependencies or additional requirements.

Note: This version is a complete Rewrite Using SwiftUI 2.0, so you will need Xcode 12 and an an iOS 14 Device to run it.
