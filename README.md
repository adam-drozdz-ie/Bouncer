Bouncer SMS Filter
=====================

This is a simple SMS filtering app for iOS that uses the ILMessageFilterExtension to move unwanted messages to the "Junk" Section.

Different to other apps, Bouncer does not share, upload or send any of your personal information or SMS messages to a remote server.   All the filtering happens locally on your phone.

Messages text is checked against a simple user defined blacklist.

Building
----------------------

CocoaPods is used as dependency manager.   If you don't have CocoaPods installed, try the [Getting Started Guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)

Run `pod install` in the project root to install dependencies, and then open the .workspace file in XCode.
